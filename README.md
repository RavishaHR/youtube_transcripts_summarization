# youtube_transcripts_summarization
A Chrome Extension which will make a request to a
backend REST API where it will perform NLP and respond with a summarized version of a
YouTube transcript.

Enormous number of video recordings are being created and shared on the Internet
throughout the day. It has become really difficult to spend time watching such videos which
may have a longer duration than expected and sometimes our efforts may become futile if
we couldn't find relevant information out of it. Summarizing transcripts of such videos
automatically allows us to quickly lookout for the important patterns in the video and helps
us to save time and effort to go through the whole content of the video.
